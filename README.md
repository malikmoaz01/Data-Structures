Data Structures in C++

Introduction:
Data Structures play a fundamental role in computer science and programming, providing efficient ways to store, organize, and manipulate data. This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C++, along with explanations and examples to demonstrate their usage and benefits.

Data Structures Included:

    **Array:**: A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations, allowing efficient random access to elements based on their index.
    **Linked List**: A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each containing a data field and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
    **Stack:**: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure that supports two primary operations: push (to add an element) and pop (to remove the top element).
    **Queue:**: A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure that supports two primary operations: enqueue (to add an element) and dequeue (to remove the front element).
    **Tree:** A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a designated node called the root and no cycles allowed.
    **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary tree data structure where each node has at most two children, and the left child is less than the parent, while the right child is greater.
    **Heap:** A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, with the root node containing the maximum (or minimum) element.
    **Hash Table:** A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, mapping keys to values using a hash function to compute an index into an array.
   ** Graph:** A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges, representing relationships between pairs of elements.

Features:

    Implementation: Each data structure is implemented in C++ with detailed explanations of the underlying concepts and algorithms.
    Usage Examples: Examples are provided to illustrate how to create, manipulate, and traverse each data structure effectively.
    Complexity Analysis: The time and space complexities of key operations are analyzed to understand the performance characteristics of each data structure.
    Applications: Real-world applications and scenarios where each data structure can be used are discussed to demonstrate their practical relevance.

Usage:

    Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the Git command:

    bash
